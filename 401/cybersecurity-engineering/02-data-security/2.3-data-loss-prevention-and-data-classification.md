# 2.3 - Data Loss Prevention and Data Classification

### Reading:

[What is Data Loss Prevention (DLP)?](https://digitalguardian.com/blog/what-data-loss-prevention-dlp-definition-data-loss-prevention)

### Prompts:

1. How would you convince your organization about the importance of implementing a DLP solution?
   * I would highlight the risks associated with data breaches, and the importance of forward-thinking when it comes to compliance mindsets. If that didn't work, I might mention how limited the pool of individuals who focus on data loss prevention is, and how software is a cheap alternative to lawsuits.
2. How would you explain the three main use cases for DLP to friends or family?
   * **Personal Information Protection / Compliance:** DLP helps ensure compliance when dealing with PII/PHI/PCI as it can tag and monitor sensitive information.
   * **Intellectual Property Protection:** DLP safeguards them from having data being stolen or misused.
   * **Data Visibility:** DLP lets you see and control how data moves around, providing insight into how an organization interacts with its data.
