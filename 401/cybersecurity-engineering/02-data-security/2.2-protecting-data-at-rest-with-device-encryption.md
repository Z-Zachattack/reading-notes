# 2.2 - Protecting Data at Rest with Device Encryption

### Reading:

[Data Protection: Data In transit vs. Data At Rest](https://digitalguardian.com/blog/data-protection-data-in-transit-vs-data-at-rest)

### Prompts:

1. From your day to day computer use, provide examples of when data is at rest and when it is in transit.
   * **Data at Rest:** When your photos are stored on your laptop's hard drive or a document resides on a USB flash drive.
   * **Data in Transit:** Sending an email attachment or streaming a video online, where the information is actively moving between devices or over the internet.
2. Explain the role data encryption with regards to the CIA triad.
   * Data encryption aligns with the Confidentiality aspect of the CIA triad by ensuring that sensitive information remains private and unreadable to unauthorized individuals.
   * Additionally, encryption contributes to Integrity by safeguarding data from unauthorized alterations, and to Availability by allowing secure access only to those with proper decryption keys, thus preventing data compromise.
