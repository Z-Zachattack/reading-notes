# 3.2 - Log Analysis with Splunk

### Reading:

[What is a SOC?](https://www.splunk.com/en\_us/data-insider/what-is-a-security-operations-center.html)

### Prompts:

1. What are three tasks which SOCs often perform?
   1. Security Monitoring
   2. Incident Response
   3. Log Management & Compliance Reporting
2. Explain what a SIEM solution is and how the SOC utilizes it in non-technical terms.
   * A SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) is a system solution that helps organize and manage security information. The relationship between a SIEM and SOC could be the relationship between spec-ops (SOC) and intelligence personnel (SIEM) gathering information so that seal team 6 can take out the baddie.
3. How does the typical SOC team structure resemble the structure of an IT Help Desk.
   * Both SOC teams and IT teams have a heirarchail structure. This aids in problem escalation, and trying to get ahead of future problems.
