# 1.2 - Cloud Security Principles and Frameworks

### Reading:

[AWS Architecture Blog - Compute Abstractions on AWS: A Visual Story](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/compute-abstractions-on-aws-a-visual-story/)

### Prompts:

1. Explain the levels of abstraction in AWS to someone without a technical background.
   * AWS provides various computing options, from traditional virtual machines to fully managed services.
   * Users can choose based on their technical expertise, with higher abstractions offloading more tasks to AWS.
2. What are the control plane and data plane responsible for in container abstraction?
   * _Control Plane:_ Manages container orchestration and lifecycle (e.g., ECS, EKS).
   * _Data Plane:_ Manages actual capacity for running containers; often, users handle this part with their EC2 instances.
3. Where does AWS Lambda fall in the layers of abstraction and what makes it so special?
   * A serverless service, representing a high level of abstraction.
   * Special Features:
     * Event-driven model.
     * No need to manage infrastructure.
     * Cost-efficient, paying only for actual usage.

### Things I want to know more about:

I would like to know more about the evolving relationship between humans and technology and the ethical dimensions of technological choices.
