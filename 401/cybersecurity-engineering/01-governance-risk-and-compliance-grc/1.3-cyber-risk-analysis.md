# 1.3 - Cyber Risk Analysis

### Reading:

[Security and Risk Management](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/certification/security-risk-management/)

### Prompts:

1. Consider a bank ATM that allows users to access bank account balances. What measures can the ATM incorporate to cover the principles of the CIA triad?
   * **Confidentiality:** Encryption, secure PIN entry.
   * **Integrity:** Secure data channels, digital signatures.
   * **Availability:** Redundancy, fault tolerance, backup power.
2. Name three best practices that support the CIA triad.
   * **Separation of Duties:** Prevents concentration of power, enhancing confidentiality and integrity.
   * **Least Privilege:** Limits user access to only necessary functions, supporting confidentiality.
   * **Dual Control:** Requires collaboration for critical tasks, improving integrity.
3. What are the three stages of the risk management lifecycle? What is each stage’s main goal or objective?
   * **Risk Assessment:**
     * **Objective:** Identify, evaluate assets, threats, and vulnerabilities.
   * **Risk Analysis:**
     * **Objective:** Analyze risks qualitatively and quantitatively.
   * **Risk Mitigation/Response:**
     * **Objective:** Reduce, transfer, accept, or reject risks, with ongoing monitoring.
